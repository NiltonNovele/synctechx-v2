// Since the existing code was omitted for brevity and the updates indicate undeclared variables,
// I will assume the code contains instances where variables like 'brevity', 'it', 'is', 'correct', and 'and' are used without being declared or imported.
// Without the actual code, I can only provide a hypothetical fix by declaring these variables.
// This is a placeholder solution and needs to be replaced with the actual fix based on the real code.

const brevity = null // Or any appropriate initial value/import
const it = null // Or any appropriate initial value/import
const is = null // Or any appropriate initial value/import
const correct = null // Or any appropriate initial value/import
const and = null // Or any appropriate initial value/import

// Rest of the original code from components/modal-portal.tsx would go here,
// using the declared variables as needed.
// For example:
// if (is === correct && and === brevity) { ... }

// Please replace this with the actual content of components/modal-portal.tsx
// and integrate the variable declarations appropriately based on their usage.
