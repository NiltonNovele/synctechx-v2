## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of the Shibaccus Web project seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly by following these steps:

1. **Do Not Disclose Publicly**: Avoid disclosing the issue in public forums, such as GitHub issues, until it has been addressed.
2. **Contact the Maintainer**: Send a detailed report to the project maintainer at [@VoxDroid](https://github.com/VoxDroid) via GitHub or through other private communication channels (e.g., email, if provided).
3. **Provide Details**:
   - Describe the vulnerability and its potential impact.
   - Include steps to reproduce the issue, if possible.
   - Specify the affected version or commit.
4. **Expect a Response**: The maintainer will acknowledge your report within 48 hours and work with you to assess and address the issue.

## Resolution Process
- Once a vulnerability is confirmed, the maintainers will prioritize and develop a fix.
- A patch will be applied to the `main` branch and included in the next release.
- You will be notified when the issue is resolved and credited (if desired) in the release notes or documentation, unless you prefer to remain anonymous.

## Security Best Practices
To enhance the security of your local setup:
- Keep dependencies up to date by running `npm update`.
- Use the latest version of Node.js (v18.0 or higher).
- Avoid exposing sensitive information in configuration files or public repositories.
